    <p>
        Recently, the site went offline from the internet. Not in the way you would think though...
        If you visited the site anyime in the last 4-5 days you would notice you would recieve a 'welcome to nginx' screen.
        This is because my drive that I store the websites contents on got unplugged, and i never fixed it.
        The site should be back online now. You can <a href="http://archive.bkjs.us">check now</a> if you feel like it.
