    <h1>NewTab Search</h1>

        I changed the newtab pages to have a search box. Before I tried this but I was lazy and was using the default google custom search engine or whatever.
        It was really bad and I gave up at the time. Until today!

        I learned that all a google search is, is a URL you visit. Say I googled:
      </p>
      <pre>Why is my dog dead</pre>
      <p>
        it would redirect me to 
      </p>
      <pre>https://google.com/search?=why-is-my-dog-dead</pre>
      <p>
        So I just made a input box that goes to that URL with your search added to the end of it. 
        I also made it autoselect so you can just start typing when you are on the page.

        bprog is a project I started last week and felt really motivated to work on but I kinda lost interest.
        I will keep it on the website for now but I dont know if I will keep working on it.
