    <h1>Pages Intro</h1>
    <small>Posted March 25, 2022 by <a href="#">brody</a></small>
    <p>
        /pages/ is a new directory where all old one-off pages will be stored.
        All pages except for /homepage/. I'm going to keep /homepage/ in the main directory because some people might have it bookmarked and I dont feel like changing it.
        Here is a list of everything I have moved their.
    </p>
    <pre>/contact/ ===> /pages/contact/
/newtab/ ===> /pages/newtab/
/deprecated/ ===> /pages/deprecated/</pre>
    <p>
        I hope the new change makes the site easier to navigate if you type in manual URL's.
        You can also see all of the pages at the <a href="../../pages/">/pages/</a> URL. This page also shows when the last time the page was updated, somthing previously not shown.
    </p>
    <h2>Displayed URL Change</h3>
    <p>
        I changed the way that URLs look on pages like /projects/ or /pages/.
        Instead of it saying somthing like /kimmu/ it now says /projects/kimmu/. Before the naming system didnt make any sense and I wanted to make the slashes do somthing.

        Thats all for now. Expect a new blog post in a few days about another OCD site restructure :) byeeeee
