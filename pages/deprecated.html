    Newtab (<a href="https://bkjs.us/pages/newtab/">bkjs.us/pages/newtab/</a>)
    <blockquote>
      Ended on 7/13/2022 due to the fact that I didnt use it anymore and I didnt feel 
      like making a custom theme for it on the new PHP site.

    Archive (<a href="https://archive.bkjs.us">archive.bkjs.us</a>)
    <blockquote>
      Ended on 3/20/2022 due to bandwith issues and lack of motivation.<br>
      The projects URL now redirects you to a blog post that goes more in-depth.<br>
      The original project page is also missing as of now.

    <blockquote>
      Last commit was on 1/18/2022.
      I basically just moved onto <a href="../../projects/kimmu/">/projects/kimmu/</a> because of how messey the code was.
